# Combining segmentations and spatial information
Repository gathering Matlab scripts combining segmentation maps from [Ilastik](www.ilastik.org) software and spatial information (atlas regions) obtained after anchoring using QuickNII.
![example](images/example_img.png)
The main objective is to provide regional information about the objects (single cells, plaques, etc...) extracted from the microscopy sections.

Any request about these scripts should be directed to christopher dot coello at gmail dot com.

***Important: these scripts have been developped for the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas at 25 \(\mu m\) resoution. Even if extending the script to other atlases might be trivial, no test have been made with rat or human atlases. In addition, real world spatial coordinates will be incorrect when changing atlas (because of orientation standards)***

## General description of the workflow
The workflow can be decomposed in four steps, described in the workflow.
![example](images/workflow_script.svg)

The first step (`quantify_dataset.m`) is to generate a list of all the individual objects together with the region they belong to. The second step (`combine_obj_seg.m`) is to combine these individual objects to obtain regional information. The third step (optional, `combine_hierarchy.m`) is to gather regions following a hierarchy to generate results at a coarse regional level.

## Usage
**Step 1:** generate list of individual objects and its associated regions
```matlabsession
>> output_json_file = quantify_dataset('C:\data\test\cs\study_info.json');
```
**Step 2:** combine these individual objects to obtain regional information
```matlabsession
>> stats_json_file = combine_obj_reg(output_json_file);
```
**Step 3** hierarchy
```matlabsession
>> combine_hierarchy(stats_json_fn,'C:\data\test\cs\study_info.json')
```


## Inputs
The input is formatted as a JSON file. This JSON file is referred as `study_info.json` in this document. This file will be given as input of the function `quantify_dataset`. Remember that Windows path have to be entered with double backslashes (`\\`) and not simple backslashes (`\`). The last entry line does not finish with a comma (`,`).

**Step 3**

## Important

### Harvesting the resolution of the image
The segmentation and anchoring work is achieved on a downsampled version of the original image. Therefore, if the user wants the objects areas to be expressed in real world dimensions (and not pixels), the original resolution and the original width and height of the images have to be harvested.

Four alernative approaches to harvest this information have been implemented:
 * to parse the information from a text file generated by an export script from Zen. This text file is located in the folder  **"original_dir"**,
 * to parse the information from the original tiff file located in **"original_dir"**. In a Tiff file, one can embed metadata information such as ImageWidth, ImageLength, XResolution, YResolution and ResolutionUnit. Zen correctly exports this information in the tiff files creating during the Export procedure,
 * to parse the information from a metadata JSON file (**"allen_json"**) generated by the Allen Brain Institue. The Rest API to Allen Institute data exchanges information about datasets through JSON files. When using tools to download Allen Brain data (see [allen2quicknii](https://github.com/ChrCoello/allen2quicknii)), such JSON file is automatically generated,
 * to enter the pixel edge dimension (**"pixel_dim"**) in the JSON file

 The program will do as follows :
 * if neither **"original_dir"**,**"allen_json"** or **"pixel_dim"** are specified, the program will generated statistics that are not in real world dimensions but only in pixels,
 * if only **"original_dir"** is specified, the program will look for a txt with the same name as the image file. If found, the information is harvested from this file. If not found, the spatial information is harvested from the tiff file metadata,
 * if only **"allen_json"** is specified, the program will parse the spatial information from the JSON file,
 * if only **"pixel_dim"** is specified, the program will use this spatial information,
 * in other cases, the program will stop with an error asking you to remove name/value pairs from the `study_info.json` file.

### Naming standards
To makes easy the generlisation of this tool, a naming convention is required in order to function. A filename is composed of a core name and and index string. The name of the file in **"seg_dir"** defines:
* the core name is the string previous to the index string (excluding \_Object Predictions if it exists),
* the index string is `_sXXX` where XXX are three digits defining the index of the image.

Example:
**"seg_dir"**   -> ``tg2576_m287_1D1_s010_Object Predictions.png``
 * core name: `tg2576_m287_1D1`
 * index string: `_s010`
 * index: 10

**"atlas_dir"** -> ``761_3165_4247_tg2576_m287_1D1_s010_Segmentation.bin``

**"slice_dir"** -> ``tg2576_m287_1D1_s010.png`` and ``tg2576_m287_1D1_s010.txt``

### Which files to analyze
The segmentation folder **"seg_dir"** defines the sections to be analysed. There fore if you want to analyze only a sub sample of the dataset, you can remove files from the **"seg_dir"** folder in order to control for which images are analysed.

## Requirements
* Matlab (2015b or more recent)
* [JSONlab](se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/33381-jsonlab--a-toolbox-to-encode-decode-json-files "Exist also as Matlab App") a Matlab toolobox to read/write JSON files. IF yu get an error message saying that the program didn't manage to install the JSONlab, try to download if to a given path and type
```matlab
addpath('/to/the/given/path')
```
in the commend window of Matlab before starting the program.
